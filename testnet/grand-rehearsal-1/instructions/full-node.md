# Running a Full Node

## Step 1: Installing

First things first, let's install the `nobled` daemon on your machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/noble-assets/noble
cd noble
git checkout v4.0.1
make install
```

Please note that the above instructions assume that you have Go installed. If everything is configured correctly with your Go path, you should be able to verify that `nobled` has been installed correctly by running `nobled version`.

## Step 2: Initialising

Next, you will want to initialise your full node.

```shell
nobled init <your moniker here>
```

This will initialise the `.noble` directory on your machine.

## Step 3: Configuring

Next, you will want to fetch the [`grand-rehearsal-1` genesis file](../genesis.json) and place it at `.noble/config/genesis.json`.

The Noble Core Team runs a seed node that full nodes can use to connect to the network.

```shell
a8dcf19336c6fe57a60a8f2091fb54f23582e6b5@15.222.245.132:26656
```

Additionally, below you will find a list of peers exposed by a few of the validators currently running on the standalone `grand-rehearsal-1` network.

```

## Step 4: Running

Finally, you will be able to start syncing your node.

```shell
nobled start
```
